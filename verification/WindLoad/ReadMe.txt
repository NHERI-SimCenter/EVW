a) windsim_dk1_input.m
Input example, which will call main function, windsim_dk1_main.m. Simply run this file will lead to the results (wind speed and force). The input parameters were made based on the screenshot of a mock-up of a new MDOF App with wind load you showed before. Several notes are given in the file so it would not be that difficult to execute.

b) windsim_dk1_main.m
Main function to simulate wind speed and corresponding force at nodes.
